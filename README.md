# Payment System 💳

A simple Java 21 project demonstrating **Interfaces, Enums, Sealed Classes and Lambdas**.

## 🚀 Features

- Interface `PaymentMethod` defines payment behavior.
- Enum `PaymentType` lists possible payment methods.
- Sealed class `Payment` restricts which classes can extend it.
- Lambda expressions used for functional-style payment processing.

## 🛠 Technologies

- Java 21
- Gradle (or Maven)
- JDK features: Interface, Enum, Sealed Classes, Lambdas

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Compile with Java 21:
   ```bash
   javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")
   java -cp out PaymentProcessor

## 📚 Concepts Covered

- Interface for abstraction
- Enum for fixed payment types
- Sealed Class to restrict hierarchy
- Lambda Expressions for concise functional code
